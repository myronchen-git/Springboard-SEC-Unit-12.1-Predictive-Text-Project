# Fruit Search

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge of DOM 
manipulation; advance array methods, such as filter and map; and use of 
Jasmine unit testing.

The project is a search box that shows a dropdown of possible matching 
words.  Parts of the words are bolded to signify the matching letters 
that include the inputted text.  Fruit emojis can be used in the search 
box, for fruits that have emojis.  Upon clicking on a word in the 
dropdown, the search box will be populated with that word.  The webpage 
does not actually display any search results.

Starting from boilerplate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, in addition 
to the above functionality, I added the logic for finding which words 
contain the inputted text, the CSS styling, and the displaying and 
hiding of the dropdown from interactions on the webpage.
